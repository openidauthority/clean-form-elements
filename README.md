Currently, flat design is the rage. Buttons are flat. Form inputs—rectangles. It's a fad among designers, and if you want to have that modern look, you'd better grab a popular CSS framework and make your site look, well, like everyone else's site of course!

But what if you actually want people to _use_ your website? What if you actually want potential customers to fill out a form or _click_ your call-to-action button and not the back button?

Can you have site that looks great _and_ is also intuitive? If you use **Clean form Elements** you can.
